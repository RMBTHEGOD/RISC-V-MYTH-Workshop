# How I built a RISC-V CPU Core in a span of 5 days.
Project Repository for RISC-V MYTH ( Microprocessor for You in Thirty Hours) workshop, conducted by VSD Corp and Redwood EDA.This workshop was conducted over a period of 5 days and in  this short span of time we were able to understand & implement a RISC-V core with base instruction set. Programming language used in the software section was C, assembly (pseudo codes) were also utilised, along with TL-Verliog for HDL implementation. Tools used: Spike and Makerchip IDE.
