# RISC-V-MYTH-Workshop
Project Repository for RISC-V MYTH ( Microprocessor for You in Thirty Hours) workshop, conducted by VSD Corp and Redwood EDA.
This workshop was conducted over a period of 5 days. In this short span of time we were able to understand, implemented and implement a RISC-V core with base instruction set. Programming language used in the software section was C, Assembly pseudo codes were also utilised, along with TL-Verliog for HDL implementation and Open source tools: spike,makerchip,etc. were utilised
